- Recursive Backtracking
    - look for neighboring cells in a + shape that have not been visited yet
        - if neighbor exists:
            - move to that cell and mark as visited
            - open previous and new cell in the direction of each other
        - if no neighbor:
            - go back through the stack and repeat neighbor check until the stack is empty
